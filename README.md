# Universal File Sorter (Python)

A lightweight Python script that automatically organizes your **OneDrive**, **Documents**, and **Downloads** folders into clean, structured subfolders.
Works on any Windows system

I know this is one of the most common scripts I could've made, but I wanted to work on my file directory whilst learning Python
